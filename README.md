# Tab Finder
Find and switch to your tabs quickly.

This is a fork of [Chris Franson's Tab Finder](https://github.com/chrisfranson/tab-finder) and currently modifed for personal use.

I will try to make this a full addon soon.

## Usage

1. Use Ctrl + Space or your custom extension shortcut, or click the Tab Finder button in your Toolbar to display a list of all of your open tabs across all of your browser windows.
2. Type into the text input to filter tabs so that only those whose page titles or URLs contain your input are listed.
3. Use the Up/Down arrow keys or your mouse to select a tab.
4. Hit Enter or click a tab title to go to that tab!

## Todo

- [x] Current tab indicator.
- [ ] Fix tab selector behaviour.
- [ ] Favicon support.
- [ ] Be able to perform action on tab (close, move and maybe drag the tab out).
- [ ] Audio indicator and ability to mute.
- [ ] Custom CSS support.
- [ ] Tab tree support. (I can't promise on this.)
